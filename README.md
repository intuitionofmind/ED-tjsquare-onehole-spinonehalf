## Files
1. README.md: This file.
2. makefile: Please specify the directory of APRACKPP package on your own computer.
3. main_complex.cpp: Use Solver with complex numbers.
4. main_real.cpp: Use Solver with real numbers.
5. head.hpp: Head file includes necessary libraries and function declarations.
6. preconditon.hpp: The file to define pararmeters and pre-construct the Hilbert space.
7. hamiltonian.hpp: To define two dimensional spin-1/2 t-J model's Hamiltonian on square lattice within the framework of C++ template class.

Please move **main_complex/real.cpp** to **main.cpp** if you want to use a specific Solver.
